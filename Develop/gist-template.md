## Regex Components

### Anchors

In regular expressions, anchors are patterns that do not match any characters themselves but instead assert a condition about the position in the string where the match should occur. There are two main types of anchors: start and end of string anchors, and word boundaries.

- Start and end of string anchors ( and $)

  1. ‌**Start of String Anchor (``)**‌
     - The caret (``) asserts the position at the start of a string.
     - For example, the regex `hello` will match the string "hello" only if it appears at the start of the string. It will not match "world hello" because "hello" is not at the start.
  2. ‌**End of String Anchor (`$`)**‌
     - The dollar sign (`$`) asserts the position at the end of a string.
     - For example, the regex `world$` will match the string "world" only if it appears at the end of the string. It will not match "hello world" because "world" is not at the end.

- Word boundaries (\b)

  - The word boundary (`\b`) asserts a position where a word character (alphanumeric or underscore) is not followed or preceded by another word character. In other words, it matches the boundary between a word character and a non-word character.
  - For example, the regex `\bcat\b` will match the word "cat" only if it appears as a separate word in the string, surrounded by non-word characters or the start or end of the string. It will match "The cat is here" but not "Thescatishere" or "catapult".

  You can combine anchors and word boundaries in your regex patterns to create more specific matches. For example:

  - `cat\b` will match the word "cat" only if it appears at the start of the string, followed by a non-word character or the end of the string.
  - `\bcat$` will match the word "cat" only if it appears at the end of the string, preceded by a non-word character or the start of the string.

  By understanding how to use anchors and word boundaries in your regex patterns, you can create more precise and powerful searches that match exactly what you're looking for.

### Quantifiers

- **Quantifiers: Asterisk (\*), Plus (+), Question Mark (?), Curly Braces ({})**‌

  In regular expressions, quantifiers are used to specify the number of times a pattern should be matched. There are several types of quantifiers, each with its own specific behavior.

  ‌**Asterisk (\*)**‌

  1. ‌**Definition**‌: The asterisk (*) matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding pattern.
  2. ‌**Example**‌: The regex `a*` will match any string that contains zero or more 'a' characters, such as "", "a", "aa", "aaa", etc.

  ‌**Plus (+)**‌

  1. ‌**Definition**‌: The plus (+) matches one or more occurrences of the preceding pattern.
  2. ‌**Example**‌: The regex `a+` will match any string that contains one or more 'a' characters, such as "a", "aa", "aaa", but not "".

  ‌**Question Mark (?)**‌

  1. ‌**Definition**‌: The question mark (?) matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding pattern.
  2. ‌**Example**‌: The regex `a?` will match any string that contains zero or one 'a' character, such as "" or "a", but not "aa".

  ‌**Curly Braces ({})**‌

  1. ‌**Definition**: The curly braces ({}) are used to specify a precise number of occurrences of the preceding pattern, using the format

      

     ```
     {min,max}
     ```

     .

     - `min` is the minimum number of occurrences.
     - `max` is the maximum number of occurrences.
     - If `max` is omitted, it defaults to infinity.
     - If both `min` and `max` are omitted, it defaults to `{1}`.

  2. ‌**Examples**:

     - The regex `a{2,4}` will match any string that contains between 2 and 4 'a' characters, such as "aa", "aaa", or "aaaa".
     - The regex `a{2,}` will match any string that contains at least 2 'a' characters, such as "aa", "aaa", "aaaa", etc.
     - The regex `a{,}` (or simply `a*`) will match any string that contains zero or more 'a' characters.
     - The regex `a{}` (or simply `a?`) will match any string that contains zero or one 'a' character.
     - Note that in practice, the last two examples are usually written using the asterisk (*) or question mark (?) for simplicity.

  ‌**Greedy and Non-Greedy Quantifiers**‌

  By default, quantifiers are greedy, which means they will try to match as many characters as possible while still allowing the rest of the pattern to match. However, you can make quantifiers non-greedy (or lazy) by adding a question mark (?) after the quantifier. This makes the quantifier match as few characters as possible while still allowing the rest of the pattern to match.

  ‌**Examples of Greedy and Non-Greedy Quantifiers**‌:

  - Greedy: The regex `a.*b` will match the longest possible string that starts with 'a' and ends with 'b', such as "ab", "axyzb", "a123456b", etc.
  - Non-Greedy: The regex `a.*?b` will match the shortest possible string that starts with 'a' and ends with 'b', such as "ab" in "abxyzb" or "a1b" in "a123456b".

  By understanding how to use quantifiers in your regex patterns, you can create more flexible and powerful searches that match the exact number of occurrences you're looking for.

### Grouping Constructs

- **Grouping Constructs: Parentheses (()), Non-capturing Groups (?:)**‌

  In regular expressions, grouping constructs are used to combine multiple patterns into a single unit, which can then be quantified, referenced, or logically combined with other patterns. There are two main types of grouping constructs: capturing groups and non-capturing groups.

  ‌**Parentheses (())**‌

  1. ‌**Capturing Groups**‌: When you enclose a pattern in parentheses, it becomes a capturing group. This means that any match for that group can be referenced later in the regex or in the code that uses the regex.
  2. ‌**Example**‌: The regex `(abc)` will match the string "abc" and capture it as a group. You can then reference this group in subsequent parts of the regex or in your code.

  ‌**Non-capturing Groups (?:)**‌

  1. ‌**Non-capturing Groups**‌: Sometimes you want to group patterns together without capturing the match. In this case, you can use the non-capturing group syntax `(?:pattern)`.
  2. ‌**Example**‌: The regex `(?:abc)` will match the string "abc" but will not capture it as a group. This can be useful for improving performance or simplifying the regex logic.

  ‌**Using Groups with Quantifiers**‌

  Groups can be combined with quantifiers to match multiple occurrences of a pattern. For example:

  - The regex `(abc)+` will match one or more occurrences of the string "abc", such as "abc", "abcabc", "abcabcabc", etc.
  - The regex `(a|b)(c|d)` will match any combination of "ac", "ad", "bc", or "bd".

  ‌**Nested Groups**‌

  You can nest groups within other groups to create more complex patterns. For example:

  - The regex `((a|b)(c|d))` will match any combination of "ac", "ad", "bc", or "bd", and the entire match will be captured as a single group.
  - You can then reference this group or its nested subgroups in subsequent parts of the regex or in your code.

  ‌**Backreferences**‌

  In some regex implementations, you can use backreferences to refer to previously captured groups. For example, in the regex `(abc)\1`, the `\1` refers to the first captured group, which in this case is "abc". This regex will match the string "abcabc".

  However, backreferences are not supported in all regex implementations and can sometimes lead to confusion or unexpected behavior. It's important to understand how they work in your specific environment before using them.

  ‌**Summary**‌

  By understanding how to use grouping constructs in your regex patterns, you can create more complex and powerful searches that combine multiple patterns into a single unit. Capturing groups allow you to reference matches later, while non-capturing groups improve performance and simplify the regex logic.

### Bracket Expressions

- **Bracket Expressions: Matching a Range of Characters, Negating a Character Set**‌

  In regular expressions, bracket expressions (also known as character classes) are used to match any single character from a set of specified characters. This allows you to create more flexible patterns that can match multiple characters without having to explicitly list each one.

  ‌**Matching a Range of Characters**‌

  1. ‌**Syntax**‌: To match a range of characters, you use a hyphen (-) between the first and last characters of the range inside square brackets ([]).
  2. ‌**Example**‌: The regex `[a-z]` will match any lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z'. Similarly, `[A-Z]` will match any uppercase letter from 'A' to 'Z', and `[0-9]` will match any digit from '0' to '9'.

  ‌**Combining Ranges and Individual Characters**‌

  You can combine ranges and individual characters within the same bracket expression to create a more complex set of allowed characters. For example:

  - The regex `[a-zA-Z]` will match any uppercase or lowercase letter.
  - The regex `[a-z0-9]` will match any lowercase letter or digit.
  - The regex `[a-zA-Z0-9]` will match any uppercase or lowercase letter or digit (this is often referred to as matching "alphanumeric" characters).

  ‌**Negating a Character Set**‌

  1. ‌**Syntax**‌: To negate a character set, you use a caret () as the first character inside the square brackets. This means the regex will match any character that is not in the specified set.
  2. ‌**Example**‌: The regex `[a-z]` will match any character that is not a lowercase letter. Similarly, `[0-9]` will match any character that is not a digit.

  ‌**Combining Negation with Ranges and Individual Characters**‌

  You can combine negation with ranges and individual characters to create a more complex set of disallowed characters. For example:

  - The regex `[a-zA-Z]` will match any character that is not an uppercase or lowercase letter.
  - The regex `[a-z0-9]` will match any character that is not a lowercase letter or digit.
  - The regex `[a-zA-Z0-9]` will match any character that is not an uppercase or lowercase letter or digit (this is often referred to as matching "non-alphanumeric" characters).

  ‌**Special Characters in Bracket Expressions**‌

  Some characters have special meanings inside bracket expressions and need to be escaped with a backslash () to be treated as literal characters. These include:

  - The hyphen (-), which is used to specify ranges.
  - The caret (), which is used for negation.
  - The square brackets ([]), which are used to define the character set.
  - The backslash (), which is used to escape special characters.

  For example, to match a literal hyphen, you would use `\-` inside the bracket expression. To match a literal caret, you would use `\`. To match a literal square bracket, you would use `\[` or `\]`. To match a literal backslash, you would use `\\`.

  ‌**Summary**‌

  By understanding how to use bracket expressions in your regex patterns, you can create more flexible and powerful searches that match a range of characters or negate a set of characters. This allows you to write more concise and readable regex patterns that can handle a wider variety of input strings.

### Character Classes

- ‌**Character Classes: Shorthand Character Classes (\d, \w, \s, etc.), Custom Character Classes**‌

  In regular expressions, character classes are used to match any single character from a set of specified characters. There are two main types of character classes: shorthand character classes and custom character classes.

  ‌**Shorthand Character Classes**‌

  Shorthand character classes are predefined sets of characters that can be matched using a single backslash followed by a letter. These shorthand classes make it easier to match common types of characters without having to explicitly list them in a bracket expression.

  1. ‌**\d**‌: Matches any digit. Equivalent to `[0-9]`.
  2. ‌**\D**‌: Matches any character that is not a digit. Equivalent to `[0-9]`.
  3. ‌**\w**‌: Matches any word character. Equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`.
  4. ‌**\W**‌: Matches any character that is not a word character. Equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`.
  5. ‌**\s**‌: Matches any whitespace character, including spaces, tabs, newlines, and other similar characters.
  6. ‌**\S**‌: Matches any character that is not a whitespace character.
  7. ‌**\t**‌: Matches a tab character.
  8. ‌**\n**‌: Matches a newline character.
  9. ‌**\r**‌: Matches a carriage return character.

  ‌**Custom Character Classes**‌

  Custom character classes allow you to define your own set of characters to match using bracket expressions. You can include ranges of characters, individual characters, and even combine them with shorthand character classes.

  1. ‌**Syntax**‌: To create a custom character class, you enclose the set of characters you want to match in square brackets ([]).
  2. ‌**Example**‌: The regex `[abc]` will match any of the characters 'a', 'b', or 'c'. The regex `[a-z]` will match any lowercase letter. The regex `[a-zA-Z0-9]` will match any uppercase or lowercase letter or digit.
  3. ‌**Negation**‌: You can negate a custom character class by including a caret () as the first character inside the square brackets. This means the regex will match any character that is not in the specified set. For example, `[abc]` will match any character that is not 'a', 'b', or 'c'.

  ‌**Combining Shorthand and Custom Character Classes**‌

  You can combine shorthand and custom character classes in your regex patterns to create more complex matches. For example:

  - The regex `\d[a-zA-Z]` will match any digit followed by any uppercase or lowercase letter.
  - The regex `[a-zA-Z]\d` will match any uppercase or lowercase letter followed by any digit.
  - The regex `[\w\s]` will match any word character or whitespace character.
  - The regex `[\d\s]` will match any character that is not a digit or a whitespace character.

  ‌**Escaping Special Characters**‌

  Some characters have special meanings inside character classes and need to be escaped with a backslash () to be treated as literal characters. These include:

  - The hyphen (-), which is used to specify ranges.
  - The caret (), which is used for negation.
  - The square brackets ([]), which are used to define the character set.
  - The backslash (), which is used to escape special characters.
  - The period (.), which is used to match any character except for newlines (unless you use the dot-all flag).

  For example, to match a literal hyphen, you would use `\-` inside the character class. To match a literal caret, you would use `\`. To match a literal square bracket, you would use `\[` or `\]`. To match a literal backslash, you would use `\\`. To match a literal period, you would use `\.`.

  ‌**Summary**‌

  By understanding how to use shorthand and custom character classes in your regex patterns, you can create more flexible and powerful searches that match specific types of characters or combinations of characters. This allows you to write more concise and readable regex patterns that can handle a wider variety of input strings.

### The OR Operator

- **The OR Operator: Alternation (|)**‌

  In regular expressions, the OR operator (also known as alternation) is used to match either one pattern or another. This allows you to create more flexible regex patterns that can match multiple different strings or character sequences.

  ‌**Syntax**‌

  The OR operator is represented by the pipe symbol (`|`). You place it between two or more patterns to indicate that the regex should match either one of them.

  ‌**Example**‌

  Suppose you want to create a regex pattern that matches either the string "cat" or the string "dog". You can use the OR operator as follows:

  ```
  textCopy Code
  
  
  
  cat|dog
  ```

  This regex will match any input string that contains "cat" or "dog" as a subsequence. It does not matter which one comes first or if they both appear in the string; the regex will match as long as at least one of them is present.

  ‌**Combining with Other Operators**‌

  You can combine the OR operator with other regex operators, such as quantifiers and character classes, to create more complex patterns. For example:

  - The regex `(cat|dog)\d+` will match either "cat" or "dog" followed by one or more digits.
  - The regex `[a-zA-Z]+(cat|dog)` will match one or more uppercase or lowercase letters followed by either "cat" or "dog".
  - The regex `(cat|dog)?` will optionally match either "cat" or "dog".

  ‌**Grouping and Capturing**‌

  When you use the OR operator with capturing groups, you can capture the matched patterns for later use. For example:

  - The regex `(cat|dog)(fish|bird)` will match either "cat" or "dog" followed by either "fish" or "bird", and it will capture both parts of the match separately.
  - You can then reference these captured groups in your code or in subsequent parts of the regex pattern.

  ‌**Parentheses and Precedence**‌

  Parentheses are used to group patterns together and to control the precedence of the OR operator. This is important when you have multiple patterns and you want to ensure that the regex matches them in the correct order.

  For example, the regex `cat|dogfish` will match either "cat" or "dogfish" as a whole. If you want to match "cat" or "dog" followed by "fish", you need to use parentheses to group the patterns:

  ```
  (cat|dog)fish
  ```

  This regex will match either "catfish" or "dogfish".

  ‌**Summary**‌

  The OR operator is a powerful tool in regular expressions that allows you to match multiple different patterns with a single regex. By combining it with other operators, character classes, and capturing groups, you can create complex and flexible patterns that can handle a wide variety of input strings.

### Flags

- **Flags: Case-insensitive (i), Global (g), Multiline (m)**‌

  In regular expressions, flags are used to modify the behavior of the regex engine and to control how the pattern is applied to the input string. There are several common flags that you can use in your regex patterns, including the case-insensitive flag (`i`), the global flag (`g`), and the multiline flag (`m`).

  ‌**Case-insensitive Flag (i)**‌

  The case-insensitive flag (`i`) is used to make the regex pattern case-insensitive. This means that the pattern will match both uppercase and lowercase letters without having to explicitly specify both cases in the pattern.

  - ‌**Example**‌: The regex `/hello/i` will match the strings "hello", "Hello", "HELLO", and any other case variation of "hello".

  ‌**Global Flag (g)**‌

  The global flag (`g`) is used to apply the regex pattern to the entire input string, rather than just the first match. This means that the regex engine will continue searching for matches until it reaches the end of the string.

  - ‌**Example**‌: The regex `/hello/g` will match all occurrences of the string "hello" in the input string, not just the first one.

  ‌**Multiline Flag (m)**‌

  The multiline flag (`m`) is used to make the `` and `$` metacharacters match the start and end of each line in the input string, rather than just the start and end of the entire string. This is useful when you want to apply a regex pattern to a multi-line input and you want to treat each line as a separate entity.

  - ‌**Example**‌: The regex `/hello/m` will match the string "hello" at the start of each line in the input string, not just at the start of the first line.

  ‌**Combining Flags**‌

  You can combine multiple flags in a single regex pattern by including them in the regex literal or by using a flags string with the regex constructor.

  - ‌**Example with Literal**‌: `/hello/gi` will match all occurrences of the string "hello" in the input string, regardless of case.
  - ‌**Example with Constructor**‌: `new RegExp('hello', 'gi')` will create a regex object that matches all occurrences of the string "hello" in the input string, regardless of case.

  ‌**Using Flags in Different Programming Languages**‌

  The exact syntax for specifying flags may vary depending on the programming language and regex engine you are using. In some languages, such as JavaScript, you can include the flags directly in the regex literal. In others, such as Python, you may need to use a different method or function to specify the flags.

  ‌**Summary**‌

  Flags are an important part of regular expressions that allow you to modify the behavior of the regex engine and to control how the pattern is applied to the input string. By understanding how to use the case-insensitive, global, and multiline flags, you can create more flexible and powerful regex patterns that can handle a wider variety of input strings and scenarios.

### Character Escapes

- ‌**Character Escapes: Escaping Special Characters and Matching Literal Characters**‌

  In regular expressions, certain characters have special meanings that are used to match specific patterns or to perform specific actions. These special characters, known as metacharacters, include the dot (`.`), asterisk (`*`), plus sign (`+`), question mark (`?`), caret (``), dollar sign (`$`), and square brackets (`[]`), among others.

  When you want to match one of these special characters as a literal character, rather than using its special meaning, you need to escape it with a backslash (`\`). This tells the regex engine to treat the character as a literal character instead of interpreting it as a metacharacter.

  ‌**Escaping Special Characters**‌

  To escape a special character, you place a backslash (`\`) before it in the regex pattern. This tells the regex engine to ignore the special meaning of the character and to match it as a literal character instead.

  - ‌**Example**‌: The regex `\.` will match a literal dot (`.`) character, rather than matching any single character (which is the default behavior of the dot metacharacter).
  - ‌**Example**‌: The regex `\*` will match a literal asterisk (`*`) character, rather than matching zero or more of the preceding character (which is the default behavior of the asterisk metacharacter).

  ‌**Matching Literal Characters**‌

  In addition to escaping special characters, you can also use backslashes to match literal characters that are not typically considered special characters but that you want to ensure are matched exactly as they appear in the pattern.

  - ‌**Example**‌: If you want to match a literal backslash character (`\`), you need to use two backslashes in the regex pattern (`\\`). This is because the backslash itself is a special character used for escaping, so you need to escape the backslash to match it as a literal character.
  - ‌**Example**‌: If you want to match a literal question mark (`?`), you can escape it with a backslash (`\?`) to ensure that it is matched as a literal character rather than interpreted as a metacharacter (which it is in some regex engines, where it signifies a non-greedy match).

  ‌**Commonly Escaped Characters**‌

  Some characters are more commonly escaped than others, depending on the context and the regex engine being used. Here are some examples of commonly escaped characters:

  - `\.` - Matches a literal dot (`.`) character.
  - `\*` - Matches a literal asterisk (`*`) character.
  - `\?` - Matches a literal question mark (`?`) character.
  - `\+` - Matches a literal plus sign (`+`) character.
  - `\(` and `\)` - Match literal parentheses (`(` and `)`) characters.
  - `\{` and `\}` - Match literal curly braces (`{` and `}`).
  - `\[` and `\]` - Match literal square brackets (`[` and `]`).
  - `\\` - Matches a literal backslash (`\`) character.
  - `\` - Matches a literal caret (``) character at the start of a string or line (depending on the multiline flag).
  - `\$` - Matches a literal dollar sign (`$`) character at the end of a string or line (depending on the multiline flag).

  ‌**Summary**‌

  Escaping special characters and matching literal characters are important aspects of regular expressions that allow you to create more precise and accurate patterns. By understanding how to use backslashes to escape special characters and to match literal characters, you can ensure that your regex patterns match the exact characters and patterns you intend, rather than interpreting them as metacharacters or special sequences.

  Sure, I'll provide you with a regular expression that is different from the one covered in the tutorial for matching a hex value. This regex will match a string that represents a valid IPv4 address.

### ‌**Regular Expression for Matching an IPv4 Address**‌

An IPv4 address consists of four octets (8-bit numbers) separated by periods. Each octet can range from 0 to 255. Here is a regular expression that matches a valid IPv4 address:

```
((25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|?[0-9][0-9]?)\.){3}(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|?[0-9][0-9]?)$
```

‌**Explanation**‌

- `` - Asserts the position at the start of the string.

- ```
  ((25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|?[0-9][0-9]?)\.){3}
  ```

   

  \- Matches three octets followed by a period. Each octet can be:

  - `25[0-5]` - Matches numbers from 250 to 255.
  - `2[0-4][0-9]` - Matches numbers from 200 to 249.
  - `?[0-9][0-9]?` - Matches numbers from 0 to 199, with optional leading zeros (e.g., `0`, `09`, `99`).

- `(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|?[0-9][0-9]?)` - Matches the final octet, which follows the same pattern as the previous three but without the trailing period.

- `$` - Asserts the position at the end of the string.

‌**Example Matches**‌

- `192.168.1.1`
- `255.255.255.255`
- `0.0.0.0`
- `127.0.0.1`

‌**Example Non-Matches**‌

- `256.256.256.256` - Octets cannot be greater than 255.
- `192.168.1` - Not enough octets; must have exactly four.
- `192.168.1.256` - Final octet is out of range.
- `192.168.01.1` - Leading zeros are not allowed (unless they are part of the octal number representation, which this regex does not support).

You can use this regular expression to validate IPv4 addresses in your code or in regex testing tools.
